Better menu with collapsible option for wordpress admin.

== Description ==
The wordpress's default menu becomes messy quickly when we have a big menu with lots of items. This simple plugin puts some color to the menu so that it becomes more distinguished and also adds capability to collapse and expand the parent menu item that contains children.
There are no settings in admin. Just install and activate. Works upto 4 level of menu. DOne with just JS and CSS.

== Installation ==
1. Upload `wpcm folder` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
